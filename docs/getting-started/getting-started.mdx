### Installation

```bash
pip install tach
```

### Setup

Tach allows you to configure where you want to place module boundaries in your project.

You can do this interactively - run:

```bash
 tach mod
# Up/Down: Navigate  Enter: Mark/unmark module  Right: Expand  Left: Collapse  Ctrl + Up: Jump to parent
# Ctrl + s: Exit and save  Ctrl + c: Exit without saving  Ctrl + a: Mark/unmark all
```

Mark each module boundary with 'Enter'. You can mark all of your top-level Python source packages, or just a few which you want to isolate.

If your Python code lives below your project root, or if you are working in a monorepo with multiple Python packages, mark your Python [source roots](../usage/configuration#source-roots) using the 's' key.
This will create the config file for your project, `tach.toml`.

Once you've marked all the modules you want to enforce dependencies between, run:

```bash
tach sync
```

Dependencies that exist between each module you've marked will be written to `tach.toml`.

Check out what Tach has found!

```
cat tach.toml
```

Note: Your 'project root' directory (where `tach.toml` is) will be treated as a module boundary, and can show up as `<root>`.

### Enforcement

Tach comes with a command to enforce the boundaries that you just set up! From the root of your Python project, run:

```bash
tach check
```

You will see:

```bash
✅ All module dependencies validated!
```

You can validate that Tach is working by either:

1. Commenting out an item in a `depends_on` key in `tach.toml`
2. By adding an import between modules that didn't previously import from each other.

Give both a try and run `tach check` again. This will generate an error:

```bash
❌ tach/check.py[L8]: Cannot import 'tach.filesystem'. Module 'tach' cannot depend on 'tach.filesystem'.
```

Each error indicates an import which violates your dependencies. If your terminal supports hyperlinks, click on the file path to go directly to the error.

`tach check` will also return an error code. It can be easily integrated with CI/CD, [Pre-commit hooks](../usage/commands#tach-install), and [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gauge.tach), and more!

### Extras

Visualize your dependency graph.

```bash
tach show [--web]
```

Tach will generate a graph of your dependencies. Here's what this looks like for Tach:

![tach show](../assets/tach_show.png)

Note that this graph is generated remotely with the contents of your `tach.toml` when running `tach show --web`.

If you would like to use the [GraphViz DOT format](https://graphviz.org/about/) locally, simply running `tach show` will generate `tach_module_graph.dot` in your working directory.

You can view the dependencies and usages for a given path:

```bash
tach report my_package/
# OR
tach report my_module.py
```

e.g.:

```bash
> tach report python/tach/filesystem
[Dependencies of 'python/tach/filesystem']
python/tach/filesystem/install.py[L6]: Import 'tach.hooks.build_pre_commit_hook_content'
python/tach/filesystem/project.py[L5]: Import 'tach.constants.CONFIG_FILE_NAME'
...
-------------------------------
[Usages of 'python/tach/filesystem']
python/tach/cache/access.py[L8]: Import 'tach.filesystem.find_project_config_root'
python/tach/cache/setup.py[L7]: Import 'tach.filesystem.find_project_config_root'
...
```

Tach also supports:

- [Strict public interfaces for modules](../usage/strict-mode)
- [Deprecating individual dependencies](../usage/deprecate)
- [Manual file configuration](../usage/configuration)
- [Monorepos and namespace packages](../usage/configuration#source-roots)
- [Inline exceptions](../usage/tach-ignore)
- [Pre-commit hooks](../usage/command#tach-install)

### How does it work?

Tach works by analyzing the imports in your Python modules.
When you define dependencies in your project-level `tach.toml`, running `tach check` will verify that the imports in your modules match your expected dependencies.

### What is a module?

A 'module' is a Python module with dependencies configured in `tach.toml`. A module can be a python file or a directory.
The module is identified by its import path from the nearest source root (e.g. `a.b` for `<root>/a/b.py`),
and its dependencies are listed in the `depends_on` key containing module paths in the same format.

[See more information on configuration here.](./configuration)

### How can I isolate a module from the rest of the code?

To prevent any external usage of a given module, you can set `visibility: []` for the module in `tach.toml`. This means that no other module can declare a dependency on this module.

[See more information on configuration here.](./configuration)

### How can I declare modules which are freely usable by the rest of the code?

This is typically done for modules like `utils/`, `errors/` or `lib/`, which contain relatively isolated code which can be used throughout a project.

Tach allows marking these modules as **Utilities**, which means they can be used without being listed as an explicit dependency.

<Note>
  Marking a module with `utility: true` is different from `visibility: ['*']`.
  Even when a module has public visibility, other modules must declare an
  explicit dependency to use it (in fact, modules are publicly visible by
  default). In contrast, a utility module does not require its dependents to
  list an explicit dependency.

### Are conditional imports checked?

Tach will check all imports in your source files, including those which are called conditionally.
The only exceptions are imports made within `TYPE_CHECKING` conditional blocks. If you want to disable checks for
these imports, you can add `ignore_type_checking_imports: true` to your `tach.toml`.

[See more information on configuration here.](./configuration)

### Can you catch dynamic references?

Since Tach uses the AST to find imports and public members, dynamic imports (e.g. using a string path) and dynamic names (e.g. using `setattr`, `locals`, `globals`) are not supported. If these usages cause Tach to report incorrect errors, the [ignore directive](tach-ignore) should be sufficient to reach a passing state.

### How can I make a feature request or file a bug?

This project uses [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/gauge-sh/tach/issues) to track bugs and feature requests. Search the existing
issues before filing new issues to avoid duplicates. File your bug or
feature request as a new Issue.

### How can I get help?

For help and questions, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/a58vW8dnmw)!

### How can I report a security issue?

Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Instead, please send a DM to caelean or nashsando on [Discord](https://discord.gg/a58vW8dnmw). You can also email us at caelean@gauge.sh or evan@gauge.sh. If the issue is significant, we will consider paying a bounty.

### What information does Tach track?

Tach tracks anonymized usage and error report statistics; we ascribe to Posthog's approach as detailed [here](https://posthog.com/blog/open-source-telemetry-ethical).
If you would like to opt out of sending anonymized info, you can set `disable_logging` to `true` in your `tach.toml`.

title: Configuration
---

Aside from running `tach mod` and `tach sync`, you can configure Tach by creating or modifying the configuration file as described below.

## `tach.toml`

This is the project-level configuration file which should be in the root of your project.

`modules` defines the modules in your project - [see detais](#modules).

`interfaces` defines the interfaces of modules in your project - [see details](#interfaces).

`exclude` accepts a list of directory patterns to exclude from checking. These are treated as regex/glob paths (depending on `use_regex_matching`) which match from the beginning of a given file path. For example: when using glob matching `project/*.tests` would match any path beginning with `project/` and ending with `.tests`.

<Note>
  Tach uses forward slashes to match path separators, even on Windows.
</Note>

`ignore_type_checking_imports` is a boolean which, when enabled, silences `tach check` failures caused by imports under a `TYPE_CHECKING` conditional block.

`exact` is a boolean which causes `tach check` to fail if any declared dependencies are found to be unused.

`forbid_circular_dependencies` is a boolean which, when enabled, causes `tach check` to fail if any circular dependencies are detected.

`root_module` takes a string enum value, and determines how Tach treats code which lives within the project but is not covered by an explicit module. This is described in detail [below](#the_root_module)

`rules` allows precise configuration of the severity of certain types of issues. See [below](#rules) for more details.

`use_regex_matching` is a boolean which, when enabled, uses regex (default) matching to exclude patterns else uses globs matching.

```toml
exclude = [
    ".*__pycache__",
    "build/",
    "dist/",
    "docs/",
    "python/tests/",
    "tach.egg-info/",
    "venv/",
]
source_roots = ["python"]
exact = true
ignore_type_checking_imports = true
forbid_circular_dependencies = true

root_module = "allow"

[[modules]]
path = "tach"
depends_on = []

[[modules]]
path = "tach.__main__"
unchecked = true
depends_on = [{ path = "tach.start" }]

[[modules]]
path = "tach.errors"
depends_on = []
utility = true

[[modules]]
path = "tach.parsing"
depends_on = [{ path = "tach" }, { path = "tach.filesystem" }]
visibility = ["tach.check"]

[[modules]]
path = "tach.check"
depends_on = [
    { path = "tach.extension" },
    { path = "tach.filesystem" },
    { path = "tach.parsing" },
]

[[interfaces]]
expose = ["types.*]

[[interfaces]]
expose = [
    "parse_project_config",
    "dump_project_config_to_toml",
]
from = [
    "tach.parsing",
]

...

[cache]
file_dependencies = ["python/tests/**", "src/*.rs"]

[external]
exclude = ["pytest"]

[rules]
unused_ignore_directives = "warn"
```

## Modules

Each module listed under the `modules` key above can accept the following attributes:

- `path`: the Python import path to the module (e.g. `a.b` for `<root>/a/b.py`)
- `depends_on`: a list of the other modules which this module can import from (default: `[]`)
- `visibility`: a list of other modules which can import from this module (default: `['*']`)
- `utility`: marks this module as a **Utility**, meaning all other modules may import from it without declaring an explicit dependency (boolean)
- `unchecked`: marks this module as [**unchecked**](unchecked-modules), meaning Tach will not check its imports (boolean)

<Note>
  Tach also supports [deprecating individual dependencies](../usage/deprecate).
</Note>

## Interfaces

Public interfaces are defined separately from modules, and define the imports that are allowed from that module.

For example, if a module should expose everything from a nested 'services' folder, the config would look like:

```toml
[[interfaces]]
expose = ["services.*"]
from = ["my_module"]
```

More specifically:

- `expose`: a list of regex patterns which define the public interface
- `from` (optional): a list of regex patterns which define the modules which adopt this interface

<Note>
If an interface entry does not specify `from`, all modules will adopt the interface.
</Note>

<Note>
A module can match multiple interface entries - if an import matches _any_ of the entries, it will be considered valid.
</Note>

## The Root Module

By default, Tach checks all of the source files beneath all of the configured [source roots](#source_roots).
This means that some code may not be contained within any configured [module](#modules).

For example, given the file tree below:

```
my_repo/
  tach.toml
  script.py
  lib/
    module1.py
    module2/
      __init__.py
      service.py
    module3.py
  docs/
  tests/
```

If `lib.module1`, `lib.module2`, and `lib.module3` are the only configured modules, then the code in `script.py` would be automatically part of the `<root>` module.

This module can declare its own dependencies with `depends_on` and use the rest of the available module configuration.
Further, other modules need to declare an explicit dependency on `<root>` to use code which rolls up to the root.

Tach allows configuring how the root module should be treated through the `root_module` key in `tach.toml`. It may take one of the following values:

- **(default)** `"allow"`: Treat `<root>` as a catch-all rollup module which must be explicitly declared as a dependency and must declare its own dependencies on other modules.
- **(permissive)** `"ignore"`: Disable all checks related to the `<root>` module. `tach check` will never fail due to code in the `<root>` module, and `tach sync` will never add `<root>` to `tach.toml`
- **(stricter)** `"dependenciesonly"`: Forbid any module from listing `<root>` as a dependency, but allow `<root>` to declare its own dependencies.
- **(strictest)** `"forbid"`: Forbid any reference to the `<root>` module in tach.toml. This means that all code in [source roots](#source_roots) MUST be contained within an explicitly configured [module](#modules).

## Source Roots

The `source_roots` key is required for Tach to understand the imports within your project.
If it is not set explicitly, `source_roots` defaults to your project root path: `['.']`.
This means Tach will expect that your Python imports are resolved relative to the directory in which `tach.toml` exists.

Below are typical cases in which modifying `source_roots` is necessary.

### Example: Python below project root

Suppose your repository contains a subfolder where all of your Python code lives. This could be a web server, a collection of serverless functions, or even utility scripts.
In this example we will assume the Python code in our repo lives in the `backend/` folder.

```
my_repo/
  tach.toml
  backend/
    module1.py
    module2/
      __init__.py
      service.py
    module3.py
  docs/
  tests/
```

In a Python module such as `backend/module1.py`, we can see imports from other modules.

```python
# In backend/module1.py

import module3
from module2.service import MyService
```

Notice that these import paths (`module3`, `module2.service.MyService`) are rooted in the `backend/` folder, NOT the project root.

To indicate this structure to Tach, set:

```toml
source_roots = ["backend"]
```

in your `tach.toml`, or use [`tach mod`](commands#tach-mod) and mark the `backend` folder as the only source root.

### Example: Monorepo

Suppose you work on a 'monorepo', in which Python packages which import from each other are located in distinct project directories.
You may package your utility libraries in a `utility`folder, while your core packages live in `core_one` and `core_two`.
You may also use a [namespace package](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/) to share a common top-level namespace. In this example we'll use `myorg` as the namespace package.

The file tree in a case like this might look like:

```
my_repo/
  tach.toml
  utility/
    pyproject.toml
    myorg/
      utils/
        __init__.py
  core_one/
    pyproject.toml
    myorg/
      core_one/
        __init__.py
        module1.py
        module2/
          __init__.py
          service.py
        module3.py
  core_two/
    pyproject.toml
    myorg/
      core_two/
        __init__.py
        module1.py
        module2/
          __init__.py
          service.py
        module3.py
  docs/
  tests/
```

In a Python module such as `core_one/myorg/core_one/module1.py`, there may be imports from other packages:

```python
# In core_one/myorg/core_one/module1.py

from myorg.utils import utility_fn
```

Notice that this import path (`myorg.utils.utility_fn`) is rooted in the `utility` folder, NOT the project root.

To indicate the project structure to Tach, you would set:

```toml
source_roots = [
  "utility",
  "core_one",
  "core_two"
]
```

in your `tach.toml`, or use [`tach mod`](commands#tach-mod) and mark the same folders as source root.

In `tach.toml`, each entry in `source_roots` is interpreted as a relative path from the project root.

## Cache

Tach allows configuration of the [computation cache](caching) it uses to speed up tasks like [testing](commands#tach-test).

The `file_dependencies` key accepts a list of glob patterns to indicate additional file contents that should be considered when [checking for cache hits](caching#determining-cache-hits). This should typically include files outside of your [source roots](#source-roots) which affect your project's behavior under test, including the tests themselves. Additionally, if you have non-Python files which affect your project's behavior (such as Rust or C extensions), these should be included as well.

The `env_dependencies` key accepts a list of environment variable names whose values affect your project's behavior under test. This may include a `DEBUG` flag, or database connection parameters in the case of tests which use a configurable database.

## External

When running [`check-external`](commands#tach-check-external), Tach allows excluding certain modules from validation.

Adding the top level module name to the `exclude` key (underneath the `external` key) will allow all usages of the corresponding module.

Example:
```toml
[external]
exclude = ["PIL"]
```

Tach also allows supplying a `rename` field to handle cases where the top level module name does not match the name of the package.

For example, the `pillow` package supplies the `PIL` module, so Tach needs to map imports from `PIL` to the `pillow` package specifier in your requirements.

```toml
[external]
rename = [
  # Format "[module name]:[package name]"
  "PIL:pillow",
  ...
]
```

In most cases you should not need to specify `rename` manually (see the Note below).

<Note>
  It is recommended to run Tach within a virtual environment containing all of
  your dependencies across all packages. This is because Tach uses the
  distribution metadata to map module names like 'git' to their distributions
  ('GitPython').
</Note>

## Rules

Tach allows configuring the severity of certain issues.

The `unused_ignore_directives` rule determines whether unnecessary [`tach-ignore`](tach-ignore) comments trigger a warning, an error, or nothing at all.

Example:
```py
# tach-ignore valid_import_fn
from other.valid import valid_import_fn
```

```toml
[rules]
# "warn" is the default for this rule,
# other options are "error", "off"
unused_ignore_directives = "warn"
```
